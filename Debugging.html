<body><p>I&#39;m experiencing the same error, but my OLED display doesn&#39;t show anything (never has). </p>
<h2>Debugging</h2>
<p>Running Notebooks/basic_motion.ipynb</p>
<pre><code>from jetbot import Robot # imports fine
robot = Robot() # throws error pasted at the bottom of this post
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>checked all of the connections</li>
<li>tried removing/bypassing the OLED from the daisy chain</li>
<li>tried the other plugs on the qwiic pHat and OLED boards</li>

</ul>
<h2>Multimeter checks:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>pHat is outputting 5V to motor controller and motor controller receives 5V. check</p>
</li>
<li><p>OLED board has 3V3 and ground pin holes - with 3.3V across them. check</p>
<ul>
<li>Qwiic connector on OLED input and output both have 2.3V on Blue and Yellow wires and 3.3V on Red. power check. I assume the Blue and Yellow are supposed to be for serial communication, so I don&#39;t know if 2.3V makes sense on those wires.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<h3>Thoughts</h3>
<p>USB Wifi device seems to be struggling to function as well. I&#39;ve been using ethernet to connect. Maybe this is an indication that there&#39;s a power problem? I&#39;m using the battery at full charge. I also used a 5A wall plug to test as well but with the same behavior. Tried re-flashing the SD card as well with the sparkfun provided image but got the same behavior.
Everything has a reasonable voltage, but my multimeter can&#39;t measure current so I can&#39;t check much beyond that. I set the jetson power mode to the 5V version.
Bad OLED board? I tried removing it from the robot and received the same error. But I can&#39;t tell from the error message whether or not the OLED board is needed for the <code>Robot</code> class.
Any thoughts before I buy a replacement OLED board?</p>

<p>Sparkfun also has some Qwiic samples.
Running:

and then checking the connection:
